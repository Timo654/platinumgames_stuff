# PKZ Repacker
Requires Python 3.

## Installation: 
Download the .py script.

By default, the tool repacks files without compression. If you want to use compression, be aware that it may be **broken** currently.
To use compression, use the "-c" launch argument when using the tool.

You will also need to get "ooz.exe" from [here](https://github.com/powzix/ooz/releases/) and place it next to the .py script.
You'll also need to find a "oo2core_7_win64.dll" and place it next to the exe, you could get it from Warframe on Steam or any other game that uses Oodle compression.


## How to use:
Add files that you wish to replace to a "replacement" folder next to the script (.py file) and drag the pkz you wish to modify onto the .py script.
The script will replace files inside the PKZ and make a new pkz file.

Thanks to cabalex for the original Astral Chain script and powzix for ooz (Oodle Kraken compression).

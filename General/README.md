# General
*UVD tool* - extracts UV data files. Tested and working with MGRR, Bayonetta 2, Bayonetta 3, Astral Chain
I didn't really add a nice way to change endian so in case you need to deal with console version of older titles, you have to change the endianness in the script.
To use, drag and drop uvd/json files onto the script to convert them. Requires "binary-reader".

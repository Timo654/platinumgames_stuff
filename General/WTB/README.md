# WTB Tool
**WTB Tool** - extracts and repacks wta/wtp/wtb texture containers. Tested and working with Bayonetta 2, Bayonetta 3 and Astral Chain. It might still work with MGRR, but I haven't tested.
The tool is pretty hacky, so I recommend using the wtb tool from bayonetta-tools. I did use this to make my button prompts mod for both Bayonetta 2 and 3. 
Maybe I'll clean it up eventually if I have time.

To use, drag and drop wta/wtb files onto the script to extract them. Drag the folders onto it to repack them. Requires "binary-reader".
